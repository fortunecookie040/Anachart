**Executive Summary**

When we were provided with AnaChart’s data on stock analysts’ ratings of the NASDAQ-100, we brainstormed several ideas related to artificial intelligence (AI). Today, what is considered as the “AI bubble” has taken over the stock market, with large tech companies’ stock prices increasing rapidly. NVIDIA Corp’s stock has taken the market by storm, causing other tech companies to grow with it. Part of what has caused this boom in AI is the accessibility of AI technology in our everyday lives, particularly the usage of large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. We used the release date of ChatGPT to the public as a benchmark date to compare stock analysts’ predictions, categorizing them as “pre-AI” and “post-AI.” Our research question was, “To what extent did the rating sentiments of stock analysts affect the 5 day returns on the closing price of select NASDAQ-100 stocks due to the emergence of OpenAI on November 30th, 2022?” which we answered by looking at eight tech companies’ stocks—Tesla, Google, NVIDIA Corp, Meta Platforms Inc, Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, and Intel Corp—and observing how analysts’ sentiments had an effect on the stock market’s returns. Our findings indicated that there was a significance in the difference between pre-AI and post-AI predictions. Before AI, the analysts’ predictions had a significant effect on their five-day return; post-AI, their predictions did not have a significant effect on their five-day return.
